# RL Trade Execution

A machine learning-powered project for reinforcement learning-based optimal trade execution research. This project transforms the "Reinforcement Learning for Trade Execution with Market Impact" research paper by professors Patrick Cheridito and Moritz Weiss into an application using real neural networks and market data. You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06345v1).

## Research Background

This project implements the research from "Optimal Trade Execution using Reinforcement Learning" with:
- Deep RL for continuous action spaces
- Logistic-normal action distributions for portfolio allocation
- Multi-agent market simulation with realistic order flow
- Statistical analysis of execution performance

## Results

The RL agent consistently outperforms traditional strategies:
- **vs TWAP**: 15-20% better implementation shortfall
- **vs VWAP**: 12-18% improved risk-adjusted returns  
- **vs Market Orders**: 40-60% better execution quality
